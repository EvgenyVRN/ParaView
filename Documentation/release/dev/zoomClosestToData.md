## New buttons ResetCameraClosest and ZoomClosestToData

Two new buttons 'ResetCameraClosest' and 'ZoomClosestToData' has been added to the right of the existing "Reset Camera" and "Zoom To Data" buttons.
These buttons reset the camera to maximize the occupation, in the screen, of the whole scene bounding box (ResetCameraClosest)
or of the active source bounding box (ZoomClosestToData).
