Catalyst now has a TimeValue option for triggering output.
A new TimeValue trigger option for triggering output through Catalyst has been added
which is based on the amount of simulation time that has passed since the last
output of the specified extract. This trigger option is more appropriate for
simulation codes that have variable timestep lengths.
