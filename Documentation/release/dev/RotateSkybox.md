# Rotate the skybox

You can now rotate the Skybox horizontally with Control + Left Click.
Notice that this binding was previously set to rotate the view. You can still rotate the view with Left Click.
This is useful when using PBR shading and Image Based Lighting and you want to change the reflection
without moving the geometry.
